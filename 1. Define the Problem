Identify and Validate: 
- There is currently snow and ice on the solar panel, and in the future there might be debris. These things are stopping the solar panel from absorbing sunlight effectively.

Criteria:
- System must be automated.
- System has to deal with ice, snow, and debris.
- System has to last 10 years.

Constraints:
- System cannot be too expensive.
- System must primarily be made from materials we have.
- System cannot block the solar panel from working.
